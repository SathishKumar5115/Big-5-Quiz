# Big Five Personality App

## Introduction
The Big Five Personality App is designed to provide users with insights into their personality traits based on the Five Factor Model (FFM) - a widely accepted framework for personality assessment. This app allows users to take a personality assessment test and receive results indicating their levels of Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism.

## Features
- **Personality Assessment**: Users can take a comprehensive personality test based on the Big Five Personality traits.
- **Result Interpretation**: Provides detailed insights into each personality trait along with explanations.
- **User Profiles**: Allows users to create and manage profiles to keep track of their assessment results.
- **Customization**: Users can customize their assessment experience based on preferences such as test length and language.
- **Share Results**: Enables users to share their personality assessment results with friends and family.

## How Results are Calculated
The results in this app are calculated based on responses to the Big Five Inventory (BFI) questionnaire. The BFI consists of a series of statements to which users indicate their level of agreement or disagreement on a scale. Each statement corresponds to one of the five personality traits: Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism. 

The responses are scored and aggregated to produce a score for each personality trait. The scores are then interpreted relative to a normative sample to determine the user's standing on each trait. The interpretation provides insights into the user's personality profile, highlighting their strengths and areas for development.
